## React Weather App

This is a weather application built using React. The page navigation at the top is a separate React component that incorporates the React Router to seamlessly jump between pages, each of which is also a separate component. To fetch the weather, axios is used. Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser that is used to grab the weather API (in JSON format) which we then handle in the weather component (in the Get Weather page). Foundation is also used for general styling and layout; our error modal, for example, is created using the help of Foundation.
